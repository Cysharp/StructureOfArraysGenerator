Installation
---
This library is distributed via NuGet.

> PM> Install-Package [MemoryPack](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StructureOfArraysGenerator)

And also a code editor requires Roslyn 4.3.1 support, for example Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3, .NET SDK 6.0.401. For details, see the [Roslyn Version Support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/roslyn-version-support) document.

For Unity, the requirements and installation process are completely different. See the [Unity](#unity) section for details.

Quick Start
---

// write iroiro.

Unity
---
Install via UPM git URL package or asset package (StructureOfArraysGenerator.*.*.*.unitypackage) available in [StructureOfArraysGenerator/releases](https://github.com/Cysharp/StructureOfArraysGenerator/releases) page.

* https://github.com/Cysharp/StructureOfArraysGenerator.git?path=src/StructureOfArraysGenerator.Unity/Assets/Plugins/StructureOfArraysGenerator

If you want to set a target version, MemoryPack uses the `*.*.*` release tag, so you can specify a version like #1.0.0. For example `https://github.com/Cysharp/StructureOfArraysGenerator.git?path=src/StructureOfArraysGenerator.Unity/Assets/Plugins/MemoryPack#1.0.0`.

Minimum supported Unity version is `2021.3`. The dependency managed DLL `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe/6.0.0` is included with unitypackage. For git references, you will need to add them in another way as they are not included to avoid unnecessary dependencies; either extract the dll from unitypackage or download it from the [NuGet page](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe/6.0.0).

As with the .NET version, the code is generated by a code generator (`StructureOfArraysGenerator.Generator.Roslyn3.dll`). For more information on Unity and Source Generator, please refer to the [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/roslyn-analyzers.html).
